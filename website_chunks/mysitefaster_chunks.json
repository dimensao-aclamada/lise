Our SEO Checkup Guide clients include Non-Profits, e-commerce companies, Govern Agencies and Banks.\nCategory:\nGeral\nDescription\nWe can say that SEO is a way that companies choose to increase websites access,Â  through a set of techniques and strategies that allow a site to improve its positioning in organic search results; those that are not derived from paid advertising, search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing among others.\nA good SEO strategy allows your site to appear in the first position on search engines results pages. Thus, your site, whether an institutional site, online shop or a blog, becomes better known, gains authority in the market, receives more visitors and increases the chances of conversions.\nBut even before we think of a strategy to achieve this result, the assumption is to have an idea if the site in question offers the ideal conditions for this. Therefore, a complete analysis of the site is mandatory, including checking in parallel how the competition behaves. The insights from the analysis have the potential to turn your website into a sales machine. This transformation is what we offer for a very affordable price!\nBut to implement action derived from this analysis?
